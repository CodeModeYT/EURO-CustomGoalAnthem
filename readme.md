## Backstory
In the lead-up to UEFA EURO 2024 in Germany, a big wave of fan enthusiasm swept across the country, sparked by an Adidas commercial. The fans passionately wanted Peter Schilling's "Major Tom" to be the official goal anthem during the tournament. The German Football Association (DFB) even gave it a trial run in a subsequent friendly match. However, UEFA dashed those hopes by announcing that all teams would have the same goal anthem during EURO 2024, sticking to this decision despite several successful petitions.

Excited about the upcoming tournament, I decided to take matters into my own hands and find a way to give us German fans their desired goal anthem, "Major Tom".

#### UPDATE:
On the 1st of June, the DFB announced Major Tom as their new official goal anthem.
This does NOT affect the EUROs though, as the UEFA still holds on to their plan with every team having the same pre-set goal anthem.
